# Unsplash API wrapper
Simple (and unofficial) wrapper to handle the public API of [Unsplash](http://unsplash.com) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cgrs/node-unsplash.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cgrs/node-unsplash)

Note: Since Unsplash has released their [official API wrapper](https://github.com/unsplash/unsplash-js), this project won't be longer maintained.

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install cgrs/node-unsplash
```
## Usage
```javascript
var Unsplash = require('unsplash')
var unsplash = new Unsplash('here goes the client ID')

unsplash.users('anthonydelanoix').photos.then(function(photos){
	// make something with Anthony Delanoix photos...
})
unsplash.random().then(function(photo){
	// do whatever you want with a random photo...
})
```
## Tests
```bash
$ CLIENT_ID=[your client id] npm run test
```
## Documentation 
The code is annotated in JSDoc format. In order to create the documentation, just run `jsdoc src/unsplash.js`

## Side notes
Please be very careful with the API limit, as it runs off quickly. Once you've set out of development, please ask Unsplash so as to increase your limit.

This library is not related to Unsplash, nor supported from them.
